# Dog Breed Identification

Status: Code is ready. Files need to be rearranged

#### Data:
The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview), which comprises 120 breeds of dogs

#### File descriptions
- train.zip - the training set, you are provided the breed for these dogs
- test.zip - the test set, you must predict the probability of each breed for each image
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
- labels.csv - the breeds for the images in the train set

#### Description 
Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep neural networks don't have all the answers. However, maybe they can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of good pup is that?

In this playground competition, you are provided a strictly canine subset of ImageNet in order to practice fine-grained image categorization. How well you can tell your Norfolk Terriers from your Norwich Terriers? With 120 breeds of dogs and a limited number training images per class, you might find the problem more, err, ruff than you anticipated
